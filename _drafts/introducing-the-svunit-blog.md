title: "Introducing the SVUnit Blog"
---

Every now and then,
I find myself wanting to do various announcements related to SVUnit.
I've been using LinkedIn and Twitter,
but these aren't really the ideal platforms for this.
A blog is much better.

Without further ado, I would like to introduce the SVUnit blog.

I'll use the blog primarily to announce new releases.
If a new release adds a really cool new feature,
I'd like to highlight it and maybe show an example of how to use it.

I'd also like to maybe write about plans for future additions,
be they new features, bug fixes or internal cleanups.
It would also be nice to occasionally share some insight into what's being worked on at that moment.

Finally,
I'm also thinking about using the blog to request feedback about various things,
like usage of existing features,
what simulators and operating system are most used,
prototypes for new features,
etc.
Since I don't have access to all SystemVerilog simulators,
I might also ask for help with testing the project on the ones I can't run myself.
