title: "Introducing the SVUnit Blog"
---

Every now and then,
I find myself wanting to do various announcements related to SVUnit.
I've been using LinkedIn and Twitter,
but these aren't really the ideal platforms for this.
A blog is much better.

Without further ado, I would like to introduce the SVUnit blog.

I'll use the blog primarily to announce new releases.
If a new release adds a really cool new feature,
I'd like to highlight it and maybe show an example of how to use it.

I'd also like to maybe write about plans for future additions,
be they new features, bug fixes or internal cleanups.
It would also be nice to occasionally share some insight into what's being worked on at that moment.

- mention that it is used for:
    - asking for feedback
    - help in running with tools I don't have access to
