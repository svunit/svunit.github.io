title: "Introducing the SVUnit Blog"
---

Every now and then,
I find myself wanting to do various announcements related to SVUnit.
I've been using LinkedIn and Twitter,
but these aren't really the ideal platforms for this.
A blog is much better.

Without further ado, I would like to introduce the SVUnit blog.

- mention that it is used for:
    - announcing releases
    - discuss about plans and what's being worked on
    - asking for feedback
    - help in running with tools I don't have access to
